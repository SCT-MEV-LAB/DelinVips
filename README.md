## Definition

Delineation filter, which is  considered a sort of image preprocessing, is a common operation by consisting of scanning an image, looking for transitions between phases and choosing which phase the pixels belong to. In general, delineation filters are implemented using edge detection filters (Gonzalez $\&$ Woods, 2002) or through mathematical morphology (Serra, 1982 e 1988).
